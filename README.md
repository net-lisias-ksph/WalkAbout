## Description

Do you need Bob to hike a few kms to get to that hard-to-land-at location? Have you been annoyed that in order to have a kerbal on EVA around the KSC, you have to build a craft and launch it? Don't want to recover and rebuild that aircraft on the tarmac just to add a new barometer?

Then this the mod for you!

Move your kerbals on EVA without having to hold down the W-A-S-D keys for 20 minutes. Place any kerbal available in the Astronaut Complex outside any door anywhere around the KSC. It's as simple as that! Dispatch a kerbal with the required inventory to repair or update your craft (requires Kerbal Inventory System).


### Dependencies

None at the moment.
